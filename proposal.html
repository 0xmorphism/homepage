				<h2>morphism – Telling the stories of morphism community members through videos</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<div>TL;DR</div>
				<div>Fund nounish, a creative agency dedicated to telling the story of Nouns, and the stories of its builders, through video. A team of 10 people; Essentially dedicating Pixel, Goldy’s production company, to Nouns full time.</div>
				<div>Lead by Goldy & 142.</div>
				<div>6 months of operations.</div>
				<div>$969K requested.</div>
				<h3>Summary</h3>
				Long-term Vision: Help make Nouns a highly recognizable brand globally and inspire ambitious builders to build on the protocol.
				<h3>Objectives for this proposal:</h3>
				Help anyone who is curious about Nouns, including non-crypto audiences, understand what Nouns is about.
				Onboard new builders & inspire current builders to make ambitious and impactful proposals.
				Rally the Nouns community around projects that we've funded and empower it to share our content.
				Enable builders to use our content to ease interactions with brands & non-crypto organizations.
				Strategy: Focus on Middle of Funnel (read more below)
				Make our YouTube channel an onboarding tool to Nouns DAO.
				Make the channel's page a shareable, digestible, and entertaining repository of videos that cover what Nouns DAO does and funds.
				Produce & publish high quality videos about the most promising projects Nouns DAO funds, to tell their stories in an accessible way.
				Publish dozens of "Nouns Explainers" covering the many layers of Nouns.
				Keep a pulse on projects' progress and share compelling updates on our social media accounts daily.
				Measuring Success
				We want to spend the next 6 months experimenting with different types of video formats, channels, storytelling, and more.
				We will track the most relevant metrics to understand what works and what doesn't. Aside from reach (views), here are some key metrics we plan to measure:
				Builder recruitment (how many people get noun-pilled thanks to our content and join our community?)
				Content leverage (how frequently and in what ways is our content used by other builders to further the DAO's interests?)
				Content proliferation (how and where our videos get re-uploaded, remixed, or used in a new context)
				Video retention (when & why do people drop in our videos?)
				View sources (where do poeople come from to watch our videos?)
				We will share these metrics publicly to engage the community and learn together.
				Deliverables
				8-10 high production value long-form videos (similar to these ones).
				140+ short form videos (similar to these ones).
				Daily posts sharing updates from builders on our social media accounts (examples 1 2 3)
				Publish a CC0 video bank with our raw footage for anyone to use.
				Accountability
				Form a Steering Committee: comprising of 4156 & 2 more trusted community members or subject matter experts.
				Provide this committee with frequent updates on our strategy and get their feedback & guidance. We want this committee to keep us accountable.
				Community involvement: Monthly reports + open discord call with the DAO.
				Staffing & Resources
				A team of 6 full-timers & 4 part-timers (142, Goldy & the entire Pixel team)
				At least 10 shoot days around the world.
				Prop 64 recap
				With Prop 64 we were funded to the tune of 40 ETH ($109K) for a pilot to publish 4 long-form videos that tell the stories of our builders.
				
				What we've delivered
				Long-form Videos
				3 videos were published
				Dustin Yellin's giant glass sculpture for Nouns DAO
				Free Glasses for Kids Who Need Them
				Funding Extreme Athletes with GnarsDAO
				1 additional video will be published very soon
